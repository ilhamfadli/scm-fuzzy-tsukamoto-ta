## Overview
This is my final project to get a bachelor's degree at Sriwijaya University, Faculty of Computer Science, Department of Computer Systems. This project is an improvement over a project I worked on during my internship. In this project, I improved several things, such as the number of warehouses and shops as well as the number of readers so that the data needed when processing fuzzy logic would be better. I also changed the reading system of the tool which used to use Ajax, now I change it to use Websocket to reduce latency.
